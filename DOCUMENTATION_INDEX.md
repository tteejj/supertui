## Documentation Principles

1. **Honesty First**
   - No overstated claims
   - Document limitations clearly
   - Distinguish "done" from "works"

2. **Verify Claims**
   - Build status verified
   - Code changes verified
   - Metrics measured

3. **Archive Old Docs**
   - Keep historical context
   - Mark as outdated
   - Don't delete (lessons learned)

4. **Update Regularly**
   - Date all documents
   - Version control
   - Review quarterly
