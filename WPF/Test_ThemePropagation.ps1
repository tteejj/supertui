# Note: This is a manual test script that demonstrates theme switching
# Run this with the WPF demo to verify theme changes work correctly

Write-Host "Test Cases:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Start demo with default (Dark) theme"
Write-Host "2. All widgets should use dark theme colors:"
Write-Host "   - Background: #1A1A1A (dark gray)"
Write-Host "   - Borders: #3A3A3A"
Write-Host "   - Text: #CCCCCC (light gray)"
Write-Host "   - Focus borders: #4EC9B0 (cyan)"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "3. Switch to Light theme (would require theme switcher widget)"
Write-Host "4. All widgets should immediately update to light theme:"
Write-Host "   - Background: #F5F5F5 (light gray)"
Write-Host "   - Borders: #CCCCCC"
Write-Host "   - Text: #000000 (black)"
Write-Host "   - Focus borders: #0078D4 (blue)"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "Expected Behavior:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "✓ All widgets update colors immediately when theme changes"
Write-Host "✓ No restart required"
Write-Host "✓ Focus indicators use correct theme color"
Write-Host "✓ Container borders update"
Write-Host "✓ Text elements update"
Write-Host "✓ TextBox backgrounds/foregrounds update"

Write-Host "To test manually:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Add a button to SuperTUI_Demo.ps1 that calls:"
Write-Host '   $theme = if ($currentTheme -eq "Dark") { "Light" } else { "Dark" }'
Write-Host '   [SuperTUI.Infrastructure.ThemeManager]::Instance.ApplyTheme($theme)'
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "2. Click button and verify all widgets update immediately"

Write-Host "Code Changes Implemented:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "✓ Added IThemeable interface"
Write-Host "✓ WidgetBase auto-subscribes to ThemeChanged event"
Write-Host "✓ WidgetBase auto-unsubscribes on disposal"
Write-Host "✓ ClockWidget implements IThemeable.ApplyTheme()"
Write-Host "✓ CounterWidget implements IThemeable.ApplyTheme()"
Write-Host "✓ TaskSummaryWidget implements IThemeable.ApplyTheme()"
Write-Host "✓ NotesWidget implements IThemeable.ApplyTheme()"
