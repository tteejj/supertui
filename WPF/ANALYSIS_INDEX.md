## Testing Checklist

### Basic Tests
- [ ] Open pane with Ctrl+Shift+T
- [ ] Close pane with Ctrl+Shift+Q
- [ ] Switch focus with Ctrl+Shift+Arrow keys
- [ ] Type in text box without triggering shortcuts

### Stress Tests
- [ ] Rapid pane switching: Mash Ctrl+Shift+T/N/P/F
- [ ] Rapid workspace switching: Mash Ctrl+1-9
- [ ] Workspace switch during open animation
- [ ] Close pane during modal animation
- [ ] Load large file while switching workspaces

### Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Alt+Tab away and back (focus restoration)
- [ ] Change themes while focus in text box
- [ ] Close all panes (what gets focus?)
- [ ] Open pane, close it, open another (focus correct?)
- [ ] Keyboard navigate (Tab, Shift+Tab) between panes

## Root Cause Analysis

### Architecture Issues
1. **No IDisposable Pattern** for FocusHistoryManager
   - Can't unregister event handlers
   - Leads to memory leaks

2. **Multiple Dispatcher Priorities**
   - Input, Loaded, Normal priorities mixed
   - Creates race conditions
   - Solution: Use consistent priority

3. **Deferred Execution Without Validation**
   - State checked at queue time, not execution time
   - Causes stale data crashes

4. **Weak References Without Synchronization**
   - TOCTOU races with garbage collection
   - No locking or atomic operations

5. **Pane Disposal Without Cleanup**
   - Pending dispatcher actions execute on disposed objects
   - Use-after-free crashes

6. **Flag-Based Async Re-entrance**
   - Not safe for concurrent access
   - Allows concurrent operations
   - Solution: Use SemaphoreSlim

---

## Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Stabilization (2-3 hours)
1. Implement FocusHistoryManager.IDisposable
2. Add null-checks in deferred focus restoration
3. Add try-catch around weak reference operations
4. Drain dispatcher queue on pane disposal

### Phase 2: Synchronization (4-6 hours)
1. Fix focus restoration during workspace switch
2. Add state synchronization (pane.LostFocus handlers)
3. Fix concurrent async loads (SemaphoreSlim)
4. Add logging to focus operations

### Phase 3: Testing (2-4 hours)
1. Unit tests for critical paths
2. Integration tests for workspace switching
3. Stress tests for rapid pane operations
4. Manual testing with checklist

## FAQ

**Q: How critical are these issues?**
A: 5 are critical (P0) and should be fixed immediately. They can cause memory leaks, crashes, and data corruption. The remaining 22 are medium/low risk but still important.

**Q: Will this break existing functionality?**
A: No. These are edge case fixes that shouldn't affect normal usage. All fixes maintain backward compatibility.

**Q: How long will it take to fix?**
A: P0 fixes: 2-3 hours. All fixes: 11-19 hours including testing.

**Q: Should I fix all 27 issues?**
A: Start with the 5 P0 issues immediately. Then do the 4 P1 issues. The remaining P2/P3 issues can be addressed in future sprints.

**Q: What's the most dangerous issue?**
A: Memory leak in FocusHistoryManager (P0-1). It runs on every focus change and never stops, even after disposal.
