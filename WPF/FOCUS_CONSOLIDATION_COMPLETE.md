# Focus System Consolidation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Build Successful (0 Errors, 0 Warnings)

## Summary

Successfully consolidated 4 separate focus tracking systems into a single unified system using WPF's native focus as the single source of truth.

## Problem Statement

Previously, SuperTUI had 4 separate systems tracking focus:

1. **WPF's Native Focus** - `IsFocused`, `Keyboard.Focus()`, `IsKeyboardFocusWithin`
2. **PaneManager._focusedPane** - Custom field tracking currently focused pane
3. **PaneBase.IsFocused** - Custom property shadowing WPF's `IsFocused`
4. **FocusHistoryManager** - Tracking focus changes for history

This caused:
- State desynchronization between systems
- Confusion about which focus state to trust
- Potential race conditions
- Unnecessary complexity

## Solution: Single Source of Truth

**WPF's native focus system is now the single source of truth.**

All focus queries now use:
- `element.IsKeyboardFocusWithin` - Check if element or any child has focus
- `Keyboard.FocusedElement` - Get the currently focused element
- `Keyboard.Focus(element)` - Set keyboard focus

## Changes Made

### 1. PaneBase.cs
**Removed:** Custom `IsFocused` property that shadowed WPF's native property

```csharp
// REMOVED:
public new bool IsFocused { get; internal set; }  // Custom tracking

// NOW USES:
this.IsKeyboardFocusWithin  // WPF's native focus state
```

**Updated:** `ApplyTheme()` method to query WPF's native focus state:

```csharp
// BEFORE:
bool hasFocus = IsFocused;  // Custom property

// AFTER:
bool hasFocus = this.IsKeyboardFocusWithin;  // WPF native
```

### 2. PaneManager.cs
**Removed:** `private PaneBase focusedPane` field (separate tracking)

**Added:** `GetFocusedPane()` helper method that queries WPF's actual focus:

```csharp
private PaneBase GetFocusedPane()
{
    foreach (var pane in openPanes)
    {
        if (pane.IsKeyboardFocusWithin)
            return pane;
    }
    return null;
}
```

**Updated:** `FocusedPane` property to use the helper:

```csharp
// BEFORE:
public PaneBase FocusedPane => focusedPane;  // Separate tracking

// AFTER:
public PaneBase FocusedPane => GetFocusedPane();  // Query WPF focus
```

**Updated Methods:**
- `FocusPane()` - Now uses `GetFocusedPane()` to check previous focus
- `ClosePane()` - Now checks `pane.IsKeyboardFocusWithin` directly
- `CloseFocusedPane()` - Now uses `GetFocusedPane()`
- `NavigateFocus()` - Now uses `GetFocusedPane()`
- `MovePane()` - Now uses `GetFocusedPane()`
- `GetState()` - Now uses `GetFocusedPane()` for persistence

### 3. FocusHistoryManager.cs
**Updated:** Added documentation clarifying it uses WPF's native focus events:

```csharp
// UNIFIED FOCUS: Hook into WPF's native global focus events (single source of truth)
EventManager.RegisterClassHandler(typeof(UIElement),
    UIElement.GotFocusEvent,
    new RoutedEventHandler(OnElementGotFocus));
```

**Already Correct:** FocusHistoryManager was already using WPF's native focus events (`UIElement.GotFocusEvent` and `UIElement.LostFocusEvent`), just added clarifying comments.

### 4. MainWindow.xaml.cs
**No Changes Required:** Already correctly uses:
- `Keyboard.FocusedElement` for checking if user is typing
- `paneManager.FocusedPane` (which now queries WPF's actual focus)

### 5. ShortcutManager.cs
**No Changes Required:** Already correctly uses `Keyboard.FocusedElement` to check if user is typing in a text box.

## Benefits

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- All focus queries use WPF's native focus system
- No more state synchronization needed
- No more desynchronization bugs

### 2. Simplified Code
- Removed `PaneManager._focusedPane` field (4 lines)
- Removed `PaneBase.IsFocused` property (1 line)
- Removed manual focus state updates (6 locations)
- Added 1 simple helper method `GetFocusedPane()` (9 lines)

### 3. More Reliable
- WPF's focus system is battle-tested and reliable
- Handles edge cases (Alt+Tab, window activation, etc.)
- No race conditions between separate tracking systems

### 4. Better Performance
- No redundant state updates
- No event handler overhead for custom focus tracking
- Direct queries to WPF's focus system

## Testing

### Build Status
```
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time Elapsed 00:00:04.28
```

### Files Modified
1. `/home/teej/supertui/WPF/Core/Components/PaneBase.cs`
2. `/home/teej/supertui/WPF/Core/Infrastructure/PaneManager.cs`
3. `/home/teej/supertui/WPF/Core/Infrastructure/FocusHistoryManager.cs`

### Files Reviewed (No Changes Needed)
1. `/home/teej/supertui/WPF/MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Already correct
2. `/home/teej/supertui/WPF/Core/Infrastructure/ShortcutManager.cs` - Already correct
3. `/home/teej/supertui/WPF/Panes/*.cs` - Already use WPF native focus for child controls

## Code Examples

### Checking Focus State
```csharp
// OLD WAY (multiple sources of truth):
if (pane.IsFocused) { }              // Custom property
if (focusedPane == pane) { }         // PaneManager tracking
if (pane.IsKeyboardFocusWithin) { }  // WPF native

// NEW WAY (single source of truth):
if (pane.IsKeyboardFocusWithin) { }  // WPF native only
```

### Getting Focused Pane
```csharp
// OLD WAY:
var focused = paneManager.FocusedPane;  // Returns focusedPane field

// NEW WAY:
var focused = paneManager.FocusedPane;  // Queries WPF's actual focus
```

### Setting Focus
```csharp
// OLD WAY:
focusedPane = pane;           // Update tracking
pane.IsFocused = true;        // Update custom property
pane.Focus();                 // Set WPF focus
Keyboard.Focus(pane);         // Force keyboard focus

// NEW WAY:
pane.Focus();                 // Set WPF focus
Keyboard.Focus(pane);         // Force keyboard focus
// (No manual tracking needed - queries handle this automatically)
```

## Impact

### Positive
- ✅ Eliminates state desynchronization bugs
- ✅ Simplifies focus management code
- ✅ More reliable focus tracking
- ✅ Better performance (fewer state updates)
- ✅ Easier to maintain and debug

### Neutral
- ⚪ Small performance overhead from querying instead of caching (negligible)
- ⚪ `GetFocusedPane()` iterates through panes to find focused one (typically 1-5 panes)

### Negative
- ❌ None identified

## Future Considerations

### If Performance Becomes an Issue
If the `O(n)` lookup in `GetFocusedPane()` becomes a bottleneck:

1. **Subscribe to WPF Focus Events:**
```csharp
// Cache last focused pane, update on WPF focus events
pane.GotKeyboardFocus += (s, e) => cachedFocusedPane = pane;
```

2. **Keep Event-Based Cache:**
- Maintains single source of truth (WPF events)
- Avoids `O(n)` lookup on every query
- Still no manual state management

### Validation
Current approach is preferred because:
- Pane count is typically very small (1-5 panes)
- `O(n)` lookup is negligible overhead
- Simpler code with no cache invalidation logic
- No risk of cache desynchronization

## Conclusion

The focus system consolidation is complete and successful. SuperTUI now has a single, unified focus system using WPF's native focus as the source of truth. This eliminates state desynchronization bugs, simplifies the codebase, and improves reliability.

**Recommendation:** Deploy to production after manual testing on Windows to verify focus behavior works as expected in all scenarios (pane navigation, workspace switching, modal overlays, etc.).
