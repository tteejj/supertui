i am creating a wpf program for my personal use. it has some i3 like capabilities - ability to have multiple items on a screen concurrently and independantly of each other, along with all htat wpf brings to the table. for my purposes i have 4 broad categories of actions to work with. projects, time, tasks and processing. everything is tied to projects. everything flows back to projects. however the project category is mainly just crud and display of specific info that i need from time to time. tasks are the main feature and one of the main interactions i will be using. tasks has all the crud, along with kanban and other related functions, just a regular display of tasks and subtasks also. time is a minor interaction i use to track time spent on projects and other administrative tasks. processing is the other major interaction. it encompasses all the areas i use when working on the day to day work on a project. im trying to come up with an ui, or interaction model that can use the features i have available to me and design a screen, interaction, display, that is better than what i have right now, which is discrete screens for each, not really tied into one another or taking advantage of the abilities and tech available. thoughts? what would you propose? can you give me a picture/diagram to help me visualize? then, seperatelym are there projects to draw inspiration from?

Have contextual cross-highlighting (click a task → related time and processing panels filter automatically).

since i can have flyouts and popups and momentary panels, i wouldnt need a dedicated left panel. my goal is a keyboard only, if possible, interaction. and so im thinking workspaces also would help this. obsidian seems like a great model to bring some features from. AND i want to emulate the style of a terminal, vibes based only - not beholden to its limitations, but the look and interaction for the keyboard centric interaction. so quick discuss further refinement and then well move to mock ups after. just let me know if we are going to run out of context/tokens. i want to get to the mockups before that happens. 

Perfect — you’re heading toward a terminal-inspired, keyboard-first, modular workspace that blends the minimalism and immediacy of i3 or a TUI with WPF’s compositional power.

We’ll keep this message focused, conceptual, and short enough so we have room for mockups next — you’re well within safe limits so far.

🧠 Refined Concept: “Terminal-style Workspaces”

Instead of a persistent side panel or toolbar, you’ll have a clean canvas with summonable overlays:

⌨️ Command Palette (core interaction hub):
Press a key (e.g., Ctrl+Space) → open a floating, centered text prompt.

Type proj → fuzzy-find projects.

Type task → add, edit, or view tasks.

Type /time → start/stop timers.

Type proc → open processing workspace.

🪟 Workspaces:
Each workspace corresponds to a context (Tasks, Processing, Time, or mixed layout).

Alt+1 → Project CRUD

Alt+2 → Tasks (Kanban/List)

Alt+3 → Processing

Alt+4 → Time tracking

You can dynamically split panes within a workspace (like i3 tiling) with keyboard shortcuts.

🎛️ Flyouts & Panels:
Temporary or contextual displays:

Quick task edit (e over a task).

Inline detail flyout (appears top-center, fades after edit).

Mini log or timer panel that can slide from bottom or corner.

🧩 Pane Types:
You could define reusable pane templates:

TaskListView, TaskBoardView, TaskDetailView

ProcessingPane (for notes, code, data)

TimeLogView, TimerView

Each pane can be instantiated dynamically via command palette or hotkey — so you can have, say, a Task List and a Time Tracker side-by-side inside the same workspace.

🎨 Visual / Interaction Aesthetic

Style:
Terminal-inspired → dark theme, monospaced font, faint scanline/glow, slight color accents for active panes.

Interaction:
Minimal pointer use. Navigation and actions through:

hjkl or arrow keys for pane focus.

Ctrl+Shift+←/→ to split/resize.

: command prompt for quick actions (like Vim or Obsidian’s command palette).

Example Flow:

You’re in the Tasks workspace.

Press Ctrl+P → command palette pops up (centered).

Type “alpha” → filter to Project Alpha tasks.

Press Enter → loads into split view (tasks left, processing right).

Press t → opens a floating timer in bottom corner.

Press Esc twice → return to full task focus.

All transitions could have quick fade/slide animations — gives polish without clutter.

🧭 Layout Model Summary
Element	Role	Example Interaction
Workspace	Persistent layout context	Alt+1..4 switch
Pane	Container of views	Split, close, resize
Flyout / Popup	Transient info/action	Task quick edit
Command Palette	Central command interface	/add task, /switch workspace
Status Line	Tiny info bar	[Project Alpha] [3 Tasks] [⏱️2h]
