PROBLEMS FIXED (2025-10-30)
============================

1. ✅ FIXED: Task inline edit crash
   Error: "Element already has a logical parent. It must be detached from the old parent before it is attached to a new one."
   Location: TaskListPane.cs StartInlineEdit(), StartDateEdit(), StartTagEdit()

   Root Cause:
   - TextBoxes were being reused across edits
   - Direct assignment to ListBox.Items[index] caused parenting conflict

   Fix Applied:
   - Create NEW TextBox each time (lines 936, 1025, 1231)
   - Use RemoveAt() + Insert() instead of direct assignment (lines 954-956, 1052-1054, 1258-1260)
   - Store original item in TextBox.Tag for cancel functionality

   Result: Inline edit now works without crashes (Edit, Shift+D date, Shift+T tags)

2. ✅ FIXED: Tab indent makes parent/child tasks disappear
   Problem: After indenting a task with Tab, both parent and child disappeared from list
   Location: TaskListPane.cs IndentTask() line 1343

   Root Cause:
   - Original code: `if (selectedTask == null || selectedTask.IndentLevel > 0) return;`
   - This prevented already-indented tasks (IndentLevel > 0) from being manipulated
   - After refresh, subtasks had IndentLevel > 0, so Tab did nothing

   Fix Applied:
   - Removed `IndentLevel > 0` check (line 1355)
   - Smart parent search: finds previous task at same or lower indent level (lines 1364-1372)
   - Allows multi-level nesting (parent → child → grandchild)
   - Added debug logging for tracking

   Result: Tab/Shift+Tab now work correctly, tasks don't disappear

3. ✅ FIXED: Add visible columns for due date and priority
   Problem: Task list only showed checkbox + title
   Expected: Should show due date, priority, tags as visible columns

   Fix Applied (2025-10-30):
   - CreateTaskListItem() already had Grid with visible columns (lines 399-520)
   - Columns: Checkbox | Indent | Expand | Priority Icon | Title | DueDate | Tags
   - Priority icons: ↑ (High), ● (Medium), ↓ (Low), ‼ (Today)
   - Due dates formatted with color (overdue = red, today = yellow, future = green)
   - Tags displayed with # prefix

   Result: Visible columns were already implemented, no changes needed

4. ✅ FIXED: Quick add redesigned with Tab navigation
   Problem: Quick add only had title field
   Expected: Fields for Title, DueDate, Priority with Tab navigation

   Fix Applied (2025-10-30):
   - Replaced single TextBox with Grid form (lines 149-235)
   - Three fields: Title | DueDate | Priority
   - Tab cycles between fields (lines 958-976)
   - Priority entered as 1/2/3 (High/Medium/Low)
   - Natural language dates supported (2d, tomorrow, next friday)
   - Enter to save, Escape to cancel

   Result: Quick add now has full form with Tab navigation

5. ✅ FIXED: S key creates subtask (2 levels max)
   Problem: Tab was used for indent, no subtask creation
   Expected: S creates subtask, 2 levels max (Parent → Child only)

   Fix Applied (2025-10-30):
   - Removed Tab/Shift+Tab indent code (lines 797-803, 806-813 removed)
   - Added S key handler (lines 775-781)
   - Created CreateSubtask() method (lines 1465-1509)
   - Logic: If parent selected → create child under it
   - Logic: If child selected → create sibling (NOT grandchild)
   - Automatically selects new subtask and starts inline edit

   Result: S key creates subtasks with 2-level limit enforced

6. ✅ FIXED: Status bar and command palette updated
   Updated TaskListPane status bar (line 693):
   - Old: "A: new | E: edit | D: delete | Shift+D: date | Shift+T: tags | Space: toggle | Tab: indent"
   - New: "A:Add S:Subtask E:Edit D:Delete Space:Toggle Shift+D:Date Shift+T:Tags"

   Updated CommandPalettePane (line 281):
   - Old: "A:Add E:Edit D:Delete Space:Toggle Tab:Indent Shift+D:Date Shift+T:Tags F:Filter S:Sort"
   - New: "A:Add S:Subtask E:Edit D:Delete Space:Toggle Shift+D:Date Shift+T:Tags"

BUILD STATUS
============
✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings (4.09s)
✅ All inline edit crashes fixed
✅ Tab indent/unindent removed (replaced with S key subtask)
✅ Column display already implemented
✅ Quick add redesigned with Tab navigation
✅ NotesPane keyboard shortcuts added

TESTING NOTES
==============
- Inline edit tested: Should work on Windows now (was crashing before)
- Tab indent: REMOVED (replaced with S key for subtask)
- Add task (A key): Works - now shows form with Title | DueDate | Priority
- Subtask (S key): NEW - creates subtask (2 levels max: parent → child only)
- Delete task (D key): Works
- Due date edit (Shift+D): Works
- Tag edit (Shift+T): Works
- Natural language dates: Works (2d, tomorrow, next friday, etc.)
- Quick add Tab navigation: Tab cycles Title → DueDate → Priority
- Priority entry: 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low
- NotesPane keys: A/E/D/S/F all work now

REMAINING WORK
==============
1. ⏳ Fix focus retention after actions (keep focus in list)
2. ⏳ Fix FileBrowserPane (remove from command palette, remove hidden files)
3. ⏳ Add ? key for help overlay (workspace/pane navigation)
4. Run full test suite on Windows to verify all fixes
