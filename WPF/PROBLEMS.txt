-encountered when trying to edit a new added task. tried to press esc to exit the inline edit. expected that add would alow entering hte due date priority etc. if not, then  that edit would allow such. it should, bth of them.

tab indnt is a problem. how do i specify its parent? when i tab a parent with a sub they both disappear. 
task should have due date, priority, etc cols and inline edit for al cols.
