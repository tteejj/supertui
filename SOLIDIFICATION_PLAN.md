# SuperTUI Solidification Plan

**Goal:** Fix critical issues and establish a solid, testable foundation before adding new features.

**Strategy:** Order tasks by dependency and minimal rework - fix foundational issues first so later fixes don't require re-fixing earlier work.

---

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION ORDER** (Optimized for Minimal Rework)

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Type Safety** (Do First - Everything Depends On This)
These are infrastructural and affect everything else. Fix them first to avoid rework.

- [ ] **1.1 Split Infrastructure.cs into Separate Files**
  - **Why First:** Makes all subsequent fixes easier to navigate and test
  - **Impact:** Every other fix will be easier with proper file organization
  - **Files to Create:**
    - `Core/Infrastructure/Logger.cs` (logging system)
    - `Core/Infrastructure/ConfigurationManager.cs` (config system)
    - `Core/Infrastructure/ThemeManager.cs` (theme system)
    - `Core/Infrastructure/SecurityManager.cs` (security/validation)
    - `Core/Infrastructure/ErrorHandler.cs` (error handling)
  - **Effort:** 2 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (mechanical refactor)

- [ ] **1.2 Fix ConfigurationManager Type System**
  - **Why Second:** Affects security settings, theme loading, all config
  - **Changes:**
    - Handle `JsonElement` deserialization properly
    - Add type converters for `List<T>`, `Dictionary<T,U>`
    - Add config schema validation
    - Add error logging for type mismatches
  - **Effort:** 1 hour
  - **Risk:** Medium (touches serialization)

- [ ] **1.3 Fix Path Validation Security Flaw**
  - **Why Third:** Security issue but depends on working config (1.2)
  - **Changes:**
    - Rewrite `ValidationHelper.IsValidPath()` to actually validate traversal
    - Fix `SecurityManager.ValidateFileAccess()` to check normalized paths properly
    - Add unit tests for path validation
    - Add security audit logging
  - **Effort:** 1.5 hours
  - **Risk:** Medium (security-critical)

- [ ] **1.4 Fix Widget State Matching (Use Only WidgetId)**
  - **Why Fourth:** Critical for state system, doesn't affect other systems
  - **Changes:**
    - Remove WidgetName fallback in `RestoreState()` (Extensions.cs:390-398)
    - Always require WidgetId in saved state
    - Add migration for old states without WidgetId (generate GUIDs)
    - Update all widgets to ensure WidgetId is saved
  - **Effort:** 1 hour
  - **Risk:** Low (improves correctness)

---

### **Phase 2: Performance & Resource Management** (Do Second - Prevents Accumulating Issues)
These prevent performance degradation and leaks. Fix before writing tests so tests don't flake.

- [ ] **2.1 Fix FileLogSink Async I/O**
  - **Why First in Phase 2:** Blocking I/O affects everything, easy to fix
  - **Changes:**
    - Remove `AutoFlush = true`
    - Add async `WriteAsync()` method
    - Use `BlockingCollection<LogEntry>` with background thread
    - Add flush on dispose
  - **Effort:** 1.5 hours
  - **Risk:** Medium (threading)

- [ ] **2.2 Add Dispose to All Widgets**
  - **Why Second:** Resource leaks accumulate, affects long-running tests
  - **Changes:**
    - Add `OnDispose()` override to `CounterWidget` (unhook events)
    - Add `OnDispose()` override to `NotesWidget` (unhook events)
    - Add `OnDispose()` override to `TaskSummaryWidget` (cleanup references)
    - Verify `ClockWidget` dispose is complete (already has it)
  - **Effort:** 0.5 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (copy pattern from ClockWidget)

- [ ] **2.3 Fix EventBus Weak Reference Issue**
  - **Why Third:** Subtle bug that causes shortcuts to fail over time
  - **Changes:**
    - Change default to `useWeakReference = false` (line 71)
    - Document when weak refs are safe (long-lived objects only)
    - Add `SubscribeWeak()` method with explicit warning
    - Update ShortcutManager to use strong references
  - **Effort:** 0.5 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (conservative fix)

---

### **Phase 3: Theme System Integration** (Do Third - Visible Impact, Low Risk)
Now that foundation is solid, make themes actually work. Low risk, high visibility.

- [ ] **3.1 Make ThemeManager Changes Propagate to Widgets**
  - **Why First in Phase 3:** Core theme functionality
  - **Changes:**
    - Add `IThemeable` interface with `OnThemeChanged(Theme theme)` method
    - Update `WidgetBase` to implement `IThemeable`
    - Subscribe to `ThemeManager.ThemeChanged` in widget constructor
    - Update `ClockWidget`, `TaskSummaryWidget` to rebuild brushes on theme change
  - **Effort:** 2 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (additive change)

- [ ] **3.2 Remove Hardcoded Colors from Widgets**
  - **Why Second:** Now that theme changes work, remove hardcoding
  - **Changes:**
    - Audit all widgets for hardcoded colors
    - Replace with `theme.Property` lookups
    - Test theme switching in demo
  - **Effort:** 1 hour
  - **Risk:** Low (cleanup)

---

### **Phase 4: Dependency Injection & Testability** (Do Fourth - Enables Testing)
Remove singletons and add interfaces so we can write tests in Phase 5.

- [ ] **4.1 Add Interfaces for All Infrastructure Managers**
  - **Why First in Phase 4:** Required before removing singletons
  - **Interfaces to Add:**
    - `ILogger` (already exists)
    - `IConfigurationManager` (already exists)
    - `IThemeManager` (already exists)
    - `ISecurityManager` (already exists)
    - `IErrorHandler` (already exists)
    - `IStatePersistenceManager` (new)
    - `IPluginManager` (new)
    - `IPerformanceMonitor` (new)
  - **Effort:** 1 hour
  - **Risk:** Low (extract interface refactoring)

- [ ] **4.2 Replace Singleton Pattern with DI Container**
  - **Why Second:** Depends on interfaces (4.1)
  - **Changes:**
    - Remove `Instance` static properties
    - Register all managers in ServiceContainer at startup
    - Update WorkspaceManager to accept dependencies via constructor
    - Update WidgetBase to resolve dependencies via ServiceContainer
    - Update demo script to bootstrap DI container
  - **Effort:** 3 hours
  - **Risk:** High (touches everything, but necessary)

- [ ] **4.3 Improve ServiceContainer**
  - **Why Third:** Now that it's in use, make it production-ready
  - **Changes:**
    - Add circular dependency detection
    - Add disposal of transient instances
    - Add scope support (basic - one level)
    - Add validation on registration (check constructors exist)
  - **Effort:** 2 hours
  - **Risk:** Medium (core infrastructure)

---

### **Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure** (Do Fifth - Validates Everything)
Now we can write tests because singletons are gone and interfaces exist.

- [ ] **5.1 Set Up Testing Framework**
  - **Why First in Phase 5:** Need test infrastructure before writing tests
  - **Changes:**
    - Create `Tests/SuperTUI.Tests/` directory (already exists)
    - Add xUnit test project
    - Add test helpers (mock ServiceContainer, mock dependencies)
    - Add test fixtures for common scenarios
  - **Effort:** 1.5 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (standard setup)

- [ ] **5.2 Write Unit Tests for Infrastructure**
  - **Why Second:** Test foundation before higher-level features
  - **Test Coverage:**
    - ConfigurationManager: type conversion, validation, save/load
    - SecurityManager: path validation, allowed directories
    - ThemeManager: theme loading, theme switching
    - EventBus: pub/sub, weak refs, request/response
    - ServiceContainer: singleton, transient, DI resolution
  - **Target:** 80% code coverage for infrastructure
  - **Effort:** 4 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (pure testing)

- [ ] **5.3 Write Integration Tests**
  - **Why Third:** Test how pieces work together
  - **Test Scenarios:**
    - Workspace switching preserves state
    - Widget focus management works
    - State save/restore round-trip
    - Theme changes update widgets
    - Config changes persist across restarts
  - **Effort:** 2 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (validates fixes)

---

### **Phase 6: Complete Stub Features** (Do Sixth - Nice to Have)
These are "would be nice" features that are partially implemented.

- [ ] **6.1 Implement State Migration System**
  - **Why First in Phase 6:** State system is used, migrations are needed
  - **Changes:**
    - Create first migration: `Migration_Legacy_to_1_0` (adds WidgetId to old states)
    - Register migration in `StateMigrationManager` constructor
    - Add unit tests for migration
    - Document migration creation process
  - **Effort:** 2 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (infrastructure exists)

- [ ] **6.2 Auto-Instrument Performance Monitoring**
  - **Why Second:** Nice for debugging, low priority
  - **Changes:**
    - Wrap layout engine operations in `StartOperation()`/`StopOperation()`
    - Wrap state save/restore in perf counters
    - Wrap widget initialization in perf counters
    - Add perf report to status bar (optional)
  - **Effort:** 1.5 hours
  - **Risk:** Low (additive)

- [ ] **6.3 Add Security Audit Logging**
  - **Why Third:** Security improvement
  - **Changes:**
    - Log all `ValidateFileAccess()` denials
    - Log all config changes to security settings
    - Add audit log sink (separate from main log)
    - Add audit log viewer (optional)
  - **Effort:** 1 hour
  - **Risk:** Low (logging only)

---

### **Phase 7: Plugin System Redesign** (Do Last - Optional/Advanced)
Plugin system has fundamental issues. Consider skipping if not needed.

- [ ] **7.1 Evaluate Plugin System Necessity**
  - **Decision Point:** Do we actually need runtime plugin loading?
  - **Alternatives:**
    - Compile-time widget registration (simpler, no assembly loading issues)
    - PowerShell-based plugins (via ScriptBlock, no DLL loading)
    - Abandon feature (YAGNI)
  - **Effort:** 0.5 hours (decision meeting)

- [ ] **7.2 Implement Plugin Redesign (If Needed)**
  - **Option A: .NET Core Migration** (if upgrading to .NET 5+)
    - Use `AssemblyLoadContext` for true unloading
    - Requires upgrading entire project to .NET 5+
  - **Option B: AppDomain Isolation** (if staying on .NET Framework)
    - Load plugins in separate AppDomain
    - More complex but enables unloading
  - **Option C: Remove Feature**
    - Remove plugin system entirely
    - Use compile-time widget registration
  - **Effort:** 6-10 hours (if implementing A or B)
  - **Risk:** High (major architectural change)

## 🚀 **EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Start Here: Phase 1, Task 1.1 (Split Infrastructure.cs)**

**Why This First?**
- Makes all subsequent work easier
- Low risk (mechanical refactoring)
- Immediate improvement to code organization
- No dependencies on other fixes

**Next Steps After 1.1:**
- Work through Phase 1 sequentially (1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4)
- Each task builds on previous but doesn't require rework
- Commit after each task completion
- Run demo to verify nothing broke

**Branching Strategy:**
- Create branch: `solidification/phase-1-foundation`
- Commit each task separately for easy review/rollback
- Merge to main after Phase 1 complete and tested

---

## 📝 **NOTES & DECISIONS**

### **What We're NOT Fixing:**
- ❌ Undo/Redo inefficiency (works, just not optimal - Phase 8 if needed)
- ❌ Plugin system immediately (Phase 7 - evaluate necessity first)
- ❌ Cross-platform support (WPF is Windows-only by design)
- ❌ Old terminal-based code (archived, out of scope)

### **What We're Deferring:**
- ⏸️ PowerShell API module (Phase 9 - after foundation is solid)
- ⏸️ Advanced features (virtual scrolling, data binding, etc.)
- ⏸️ Documentation rewrite (update after code stabilizes)
- ⏸️ Performance optimization (profile first, optimize second)

### **Dependencies to Watch:**
- Phase 4 (DI) requires Phase 1 (split files) to be manageable
- Phase 5 (Testing) requires Phase 4 (DI) to mock dependencies
- Phase 3 (Themes) is independent - can be done anytime after Phase 1
- Phase 2 (Performance) is independent - can be done in parallel with Phase 3
