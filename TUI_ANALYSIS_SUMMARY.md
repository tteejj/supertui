# SuperTUI Keyboard/Focus Analysis - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Source:** Analysis of `/home/teej/_tui/praxis-main` (previous TUI implementation)
**Status:** Complete with implementation guides

---

## What Was Analyzed

The previous TUI implementation that transitioned from console-based to WPF while maintaining terminal-like aesthetics. Covered:

1. **Global Keyboard Input Architecture** - How input flows from OS to widgets
2. **Focus Management System** - How focus was tracked and switched
3. **Input Modes & Command Systems** - How normal/edit/search modes worked
4. **Prevention of WPF Control Stealing Focus** - Techniques to maintain control
5. **Workspace/Window Navigation** - Tab navigation and multi-widget focus
6. **Status Bar & Mode Indicators** - User feedback and instructions
7. **Input Event Abstraction** - Clean API for key handling

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Focus Management is Simple
- **Single boolean flag** `IsFocused` per widget
- **First line check** in input handler (early return if not focused)
- **Visual feedback** required (highlight, border, color change)
- **No complex focus stacks** - just one focused widget at a time

### 2. Input Handling Pattern
```
Widget.HandleKeyDown(e)
├─ if (!IsFocused) return false;        // First check
├─ if (isEditMode) return HandleEdit(e); // Mode branching
└─ return HandleNormal(e);               // Normal mode
```

### 3. WPF Patterns to Adopt
- **NO global input bindings** in MainWindow
- **Attached Behaviors** for reusable keyboard handling
- **PreviewKeyDown (tunneling)** for critical keys
- **e.Handled = true** when input consumed
- **MVVM with binding** instead of code-behind

### 4. Status Bar is Critical
- Always visible with mode instructions
- Auto-expiring messages (3-10 seconds depending on type)
- Shows available shortcuts for current mode
- Adaptive layout for different screen widths

### 5. Navigation is Vim-Like
- **Ctrl+J/K** - Down/Up (instead of arrow keys)
- **Ctrl+H/L** - Collapse/Expand (left/right)
- **Ctrl+G / Ctrl+Shift+G** - First/Last
- **Alt+B** - Back (requires visited items history)
- **Alt+1..9** - Quick jump to index

---

## What Works Well

1. **Simple focus model** - Single boolean, no complexity
2. **Mode-based input** - Edit mode gated by flag, status bar shows instructions
3. **Explicit focus setting** - No implicit focus changes, always explicit
4. **Status bar feedback** - User always knows what mode they're in
5. **Vim-like shortcuts** - Familiar to power users
6. **Graceful degradation** - Widgets can independently handle input
7. **No global keyboard handler** - Distributed, delegated approach

---

## What to Avoid

1. **Complex focus stacks** - Caused bugs, simple boolean is better
2. **Global MainWindow input handler** - Becomes spaghetti code
3. **Tab navigation in edit mode** - Confuses user (should mean "next field")
4. **Silent mode changes** - Always update status bar
5. **Input consumed but not handled** - Inconsistent behavior
6. **No visual focus feedback** - User loses track
7. **Nested mode checks** - Hard to debug

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Add `IsFocused` property to all widgets
- [ ] Add `HandleKeyDown(KeyEventArgs)` method to all widgets
- [ ] Create base widget class with these patterns
- [ ] Wire MainWindow to route keys to focused widget

### Phase 2: Status Bar (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Enhance status bar with mode display
- [ ] Show instruction text for current mode
- [ ] Auto-expiring messages with colors (Info/Success/Warning/Error)
- [ ] Display keyboard shortcuts

### Phase 3: Navigation (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement Vim-like shortcuts (Ctrl+J/K, Ctrl+H/L)
- [ ] Add visited items history for Alt+B
- [ ] Explicit focus setting with BringIntoView()
- [ ] Widget-to-widget navigation with Ctrl+Tab

### Phase 4: Edit Mode (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Mode flag in text-editable widgets
- [ ] Tab cycles fields (not controls)
- [ ] Enter saves, Escape cancels
- [ ] Backup for undo on cancel

### Phase 5: Polish (Week 3)
- [ ] Visual focus indicators (colors, borders)
- [ ] Help system showing all shortcuts
- [ ] Consistent keyboard behavior across widgets
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

## Critical Code Patterns

### Pattern 1: Focus Check (Always First)
```csharp
public bool HandleKeyDown(KeyEventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsFocused) return false;  // DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE
    // ... rest of handler
}
```

### Pattern 2: Mode-Based Input
```csharp
if (isEditMode)
    return HandleEditModeInput(e);
else
    return HandleNormalModeInput(e);
```

### Pattern 3: Always Mark Handled
```csharp
if (input_matched)
{
    e.Handled = true;  // DO NOT FORGET
    return true;
}
```

### Pattern 4: Status Bar Feedback
```csharp
StatusService.ShowStatus(
    "EDIT MODE: Enter=Save, Esc=Cancel",
    StatusType.Info);
```

## Keyboard Shortcut Map (Recommended)

```
NORMAL MODE
Navigation:   Ctrl+J/K (down/up), Ctrl+H/L (collapse/expand)
Commands:     N=New, E=Edit, D=Delete, /=Search, Q=Quit
Selection:    Space=Toggle, A=All, Home/End=First/Last

EDIT MODE
Confirm:      Enter=Save, Esc=Cancel
Navigation:   Arrows=Move, Ctrl+Arrows=Word, Home/End=Line
Editing:      Backspace=Delete, Tab=Next Field
Selection:    Shift+Arrows, Ctrl+A=Select All

HELP
Shortcuts:    ?=Show Help
Mode info:    Status bar always shows current mode
```

- ListWidget (focus & navigation)
- TaskListEditMode (edit mode state machine)
- InlineEditor (text editing with cursor)
- StatusBar (console status display)
- StatusService (WPF status display)

## Next Steps

1. **Read TUI_KEYBOARD_FOCUS_ANALYSIS.md** for complete understanding
2. **Read KEYBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** for practical patterns
3. **Review MainWindow.xaml.cs** - wire up key routing
4. **Add IsFocused to WidgetBase** - base implementation
5. **Enhance StatusBar** - mode and instruction display
6. **Test keyboard flow** - ensure no WPF control stealing focus
7. **Implement shortcuts** - start with navigation

---

## Success Criteria

- Widgets can be navigated with Ctrl+Tab
- Keyboard input doesn't "escape" to WPF
- Status bar always shows mode and instructions
- Edit mode shows different shortcuts than normal mode
- User can't accidentally Tab into a hidden control
- Focus visibly highlights the active widget
- No global MainWindow keyboard handler (delegated to widgets)
