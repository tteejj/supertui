## System Overview

### What Works (85%)
- Focus tracking per widget with visual indicators
- Alt+H/J/K/L directional focus (i3-style)
- Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L widget movement
- Tab/Shift+Tab focus cycling
- Widget keyboard input via OnWidgetKeyDown()
- ShortcutManager with global & workspace-specific shortcuts
- Keyboard help overlays (? and G keys)
- Full keyboard routing chain: Window → ShortcutManager → Workspace → Widget

### What's Broken (15%)
- PowerShell missing one critical HandleKeyDown() call
- Three Workspace methods missing (FocusWidget, FocusedWidget property, GetAllWidgets)
- QuickJumpOverlay feature not functional due to missing methods
- No EventBus integration for keyboard/focus events
- No key binding configuration system
- No input capture mechanism for modals

## Critical Files

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Workspace.cs | 95% | Focus state, navigation, keyboard routing |
| WidgetBase.cs | 100% | Widget focus interface |
| ShortcutManager.cs | 100% | Shortcut registry & dispatch |
| EventBus.cs | 0% used | Event pub/sub system (not integrated) |
| SuperTUI.ps1 | 95% | Entry point, missing HandleKeyDown call |

## Quick Start: Implementing the Missing 15%

### Step 1: Add methods to Workspace.cs (3 lines)
```csharp
public void FocusWidget(WidgetBase widget) => FocusElement(widget);
public WidgetBase FocusedWidget => GetFocusedWidget();
public IEnumerable<WidgetBase> GetAllWidgets() => Widgets.AsReadOnly();
```

### Step 2: Update SuperTUI.ps1 keyboard handler
Add after line 1080 (after ShortcutManager check):
```powershell
if (-not $handled) {
    $workspaceManager.HandleKeyDown($e)
}
```

### Step 3: Test
Run manual testing checklist from FOCUS_KEYBOARD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

## Key Concepts

### Focus State
Each widget has a `HasFocus` property that triggers:
- Visual updates (border, glow)
- Lifecycle callbacks (OnWidgetFocusReceived/Lost)
- PropertyChanged notifications for bindings

### Keyboard Routing
Priority order:
1. Overlay keys (?, G, Esc) - handled first
2. Global shortcuts (ShortcutManager)
3. Workspace navigation (Alt+H/J/K/L, Tab)
4. Widget keyboard (OnWidgetKeyDown)

### Directional Focus Algorithm
The Alt+H/J/K/L navigation uses a sophisticated grid-based algorithm:
1. Maps widgets to grid positions (row, col)
2. Finds closest candidate in target direction
3. Wraps around if no candidate found
4. Uses weighted distance: axis + perpendicular*0.5

## Unused Potential

The EventBus system is fully implemented but not used for keyboard/focus events. This means:
- Widgets can't react to other widgets gaining focus via events
- No event-driven cross-widget communication
- All keyboard handling is synchronous (method calls only)

This could be enhanced to:
- Publish `WidgetFocusReceivedEvent` / `WidgetFocusLostEvent`
- Allow event-driven keyboard handling
- Enable advanced focus management features

## Architecture Strengths

- Clean separation of concerns (focus logic vs keyboard handling)
- WPF patterns used correctly (HasFocus, Focus(), events)
- Hierarchical keyboard routing (window → workspace → widget)
- Visual focus feedback from theme system
- Extensible shortcut system
- Well-documented code with XML comments

## Architecture Weaknesses

- Naming inconsistencies (GetFocusedWidget method vs FocusedWidget property)
- Missing implementation in C# expected in PowerShell
- No configuration system for keybindings
- EventBus not integrated with keyboard system
- No modal/input capture mechanism
- Limited test coverage for keyboard input

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Needed
- Workspace.FocusInDirection() algorithm
- ShortcutManager.HandleKeyDown() priority ordering
- KeyboardShortcut.Matches() key comparison

### Integration Tests Needed
- Full keyboard → focus chain
- Overlay keyboard interception
- Widget keyboard input delegation
- Workspace switching with focus preservation

### Manual Tests
See FOCUS_KEYBOARD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for checklist

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. Complete the 15% (3 methods + 1 PS1 line)
2. Add EventBus integration for focus events
3. Create IInputManager service

### Medium Priority
1. Key binding configuration file (JSON)
2. Input capture for modals
3. Focus history (back navigation)

### Low Priority
1. Keyboard macros
2. Input method remapping
3. Gesture recognition
