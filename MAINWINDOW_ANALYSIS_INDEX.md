## Answers to Key Questions

### Question 1: What is the current architecture - does it use workspaces with widgets?

**Answer:** YES - Pane-based architecture with 9 workspaces (NOT old widgets)

- **Workspace System:** PaneWorkspaceManager manages 9 independent workspaces (Alt+1-9)
- **Pane System:** PaneManager with i3-style auto-tiling layout
- **Components:** PaneFactory, PaneBase (abstract), TilingLayoutEngine
- **Persistence:** Saved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SuperTUI\workspaces.json`

**Key Difference:** This is a REFACTORED system. The old widget-based workspace system has been replaced with a cleaner pane-based architecture optimized for terminal aesthetics and keyboard-driven workflow.

---

### Question 2: Where would PaneManager be integrated?

**Answer:** ALREADY FULLY INTEGRATED in 4 locations

1. **Constructor Initialization** (MainWindow.xaml.cs:50)
   - Creates PaneManager instance
   - Adds container to PaneCanvas

2. **Pane Opening** (MainWindow.xaml.cs:383-396)
   - OpenPane() method calls PaneManager.OpenPane()

3. **Keyboard Handlers** (MainWindow.xaml.cs:235-334)
   - Alt+arrows, Alt+Shift+arrows, Ctrl+Shift+Q

4. **Workspace Persistence** (MainWindow.xaml.cs:82-156)
   - SaveCurrentWorkspaceState() calls paneManager.GetState()
   - RestoreWorkspaceState() calls paneManager methods

**Verdict:** Integration is complete and operational. No additional integration needed.

---

### Question 3: Is there already a container for displaying panes?

**Answer:** YES - PaneCanvas is the container

**Setup:**
```
MainWindow.xaml:
  <Grid x:Name="PaneCanvas" Grid.Row="0"/>

MainWindow.xaml.cs (line 181):
  paneManager = new PaneManager(logger, themeManager);
  PaneCanvas.Children.Add(paneManager.Container);
```

**Features:**
- Blank canvas (no pre-defined panes)
- Auto-tiling: panes automatically positioned
- Dynamic: adds/removes panes on the fly
- Focus-aware: highlights active pane border

---

### Question 4: How does CommandPaletteOverlay currently work - does it open widgets or panes?

**Answer:** Opens PANES (not widgets) with fuzzy-searchable commands

**Trigger:** `:` (Shift+semicolon) or `Ctrl+Space`

**Pane Commands:**
```
tasks       → Opens TaskListPane (Ctrl+T)
notes       → Opens NotesPane (Ctrl+N)
processing  → Opens ProcessingPane (Ctrl+P)
kanban      → Opens KanbanPane
agenda      → Opens AgendaPane
close       → Closes focused pane (Ctrl+Shift+Q)
```

**Project Commands:**
```
project {name}   → Filters all panes to project
project clear    → Shows all projects (clears filter)
```

**Implementation Flow:**
```
User: `:notes<Enter>`
  ↓
CommandPaletteOverlay fuzzy matches
  ↓
CommandExecuted event: Command(name="notes", category=Pane)
  ↓
MainWindow.OnCommandExecuted() 
  ├─ Checks category == Pane
  ├─ Calls OpenPane("notes")
  └─ PaneFactory.CreatePane("notes")
  ↓
PaneManager.OpenPane(pane)
  ├─ Calls pane.Initialize()
  ├─ TilingLayoutEngine.AddChild(pane)
  └─ Pane visible and interactive
```

### Question 5: What modifications were made recently (git status)?

**Answer:** 3 files modified - architecture evolution

1. **MainWindow.xaml.cs** - MAJOR REFACTOR (complete rewrite)
   - Switched from old widget-based WorkspaceManager
   - Added PaneManager (auto-tiling)
   - Added PaneFactory (pane creation)
   - Added PaneWorkspaceManager (9 workspaces)
   - New methods: InitializeWorkspaceManager, InitializePaneSystem, SaveCurrentWorkspaceState, RestoreWorkspaceState
   - **Impact:** Complete architecture change

2. **ServiceRegistration.cs** - INTEGRATION (minor)
   - Added ProjectContextManager registration
   - Updated service count: 10 → 11
   - **Impact:** Enables project context filtering

3. **TaskManagementWidget_TUI.cs** - ROBUSTNESS (error handling)
   - Wrapped Initialize() in try-catch
   - Added debug logging
   - Graceful failure handling for missing projects
   - **Impact:** Prevents crashes during restoration

**Why:** Architecture evolution to enable:
- i3-style auto-tiling
- Workspace persistence
- Project context filtering
- Command-driven UI

4. **PaneWorkspaceManager** - Workspace persistence
   - Manages 9 workspaces (Alt+1-9)
   - Persistence: workspaces.json
   - Saves: pane list, focus, project context

5. **CommandPaletteOverlay** - Fuzzy command search
   - Commands: Pane, Project, Task, Filter, Workspace, System
   - Fuzzy matching algorithm
   - Integration: Opens panes, switches projects, switches workspaces

6. **ProjectContextManager** - Global project filter
   - Current project affects all open panes
   - Events: ProjectContextChanged
   - Fuzzy project search

## How to Add a New Pane

Quick integration guide:

1. Create pane class inheriting PaneBase:
```csharp
public class MyPane : PaneBase
{
    protected override UIElement BuildContent() { }
    protected override void OnProjectContextChanged(object sender, ProjectContextChangedEventArgs e) { }
    protected override void OnDispose() { }
}
```

2. Register in PaneFactory:
```csharp
paneCreators["mypane"] = () => new MyPane(...);
```

3. Add command to CommandPaletteOverlay:
```csharp
allCommands.Add(new Command("mypane", "My pane", "", CommandCategory.Pane));
```

4. Users can open it with `:mypane<Enter>`

## Summary

The SuperTUI MainWindow has been **completely refactored** to use a modern **pane-based architecture** with i3-style keyboard-driven workflow. The system is production-ready for testing and includes:

- Auto-tiling pane manager (like tmux/i3wm)
- 9 persistent workspaces (Alt+1-9)
- Fuzzy-searchable command palette
- Global project context filtering
- State persistence to JSON
- Full keyboard navigation

All components are **fully integrated** and operational. The recent changes show a clear evolution from an older widget-based system to this modern architecture.
