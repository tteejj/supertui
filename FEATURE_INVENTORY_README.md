## For Developers

### Understanding the Architecture
1. **DI & Services:** All widgets inject services via constructor
2. **Memory Safety:** All widgets implement IDisposable with OnDispose()
3. **Event Communication:** Use EventBus for inter-widget messages
4. **Error Handling:** Use ErrorHandlingPolicy for standardized responses
5. **State Preservation:** Implement SaveState/RestoreState

### Adding a New Widget
1. Implement WidgetBase
2. Add interfaces for required services (ITaskService, etc.)
3. Implement Initialize(), BuildUI(), OnDispose()
4. Add to WidgetFactory
5. Register in workspace

### Adding a New Service
1. Create interface in `/Core/Interfaces/IYourService.cs`
2. Implement service class
3. Register in ServiceContainer
4. Make injectable via constructor
